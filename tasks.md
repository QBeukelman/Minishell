# Tasks

## Uncertainties

> How does << work? Add delimiter to parser and lexer. 
Do we have to handle no given heredoc? (cat << END > output.txt)

> 

---
<br />


## Next Step

> Create `fork()` for `execve()`

---
<br />


## Needed for next steps

> Understand how `signals` work, perhaps read minitalk subject. Global var? And how to hande $?

> Read man pages of available `functions`

---
<br />


## For a later time

> Read about multiple `pipes`

> Expanding (heredoc)

> Environment

> History

> redirect as input for command ("<")

> Interactive mode (^ C)

> Built-ins
